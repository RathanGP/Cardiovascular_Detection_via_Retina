# Retinal Analysis for Cardiovascular Disease

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage retinal imaging to assess and detect cardiovascular diseases. By analyzing retinal images, we can uncover biomarkers and patterns that indicate the presence or risk of cardiovascular conditions, offering a non-invasive and efficient screening tool.



## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. Early detection and continuous monitoring are crucial for effective treatment and management. Retinal imaging provides a unique opportunity to observe blood vessel conditions that may reflect cardiovascular health.

## Motivation

Traditional methods for cardiovascular disease detection are often invasive and expensive. Retinal imaging, being non-invasive, offers a cost-effective and accessible alternative. By developing robust algorithms for retinal image analysis, we can improve early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases.

## Objectives

- To develop algorithms for analyzing retinal images to detect cardiovascular disease.
- To identify key biomarkers in retinal images that correlate with cardiovascular conditions.
- To create a user-friendly tool for healthcare professionals to assess cardiovascular risk using retinal images.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Acquire a comprehensive dataset of retinal images.
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalize and enhance the quality of retinal images.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identify and extract relevant features from the retinal images.
4. **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models to analyze extracted features and predict cardiovascular conditions.
5. **Evaluation**: Validate the models using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC.

## Datasets

The project uses publicly available datasets of retinal images, including but not limited to:
- [Retina Image Bank](https://www.imagebank.asrs.org/)
- [STARE (Structured Analysis of the Retina)](http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RathanGP/Retinal_Analysis_For_CardiovasularDisease.git
    cd Retinal_Analysis_For_CardiovasularDisease
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your retinal image dataset.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and normalize the images:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py --input_dir <path_to_raw_images> --output_dir <path_to_clean_images>
    ```

3. Train the model using the prepared dataset:
    ```sh
    python train.py --data_dir <path_to_clean_images>
    ```

4. Evaluate the model on a test dataset:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py --data_dir <path_to_test_images>
    ```

## Input and Output

The project processes retinal images and provides predictions on cardiovascular disease risk. Below are examples of input images and their predicted outputs.

### Input Retinal Image
![Input Retinal Image](path_to_input_image)

### Predicted Output
![Predicted Output](path_to_output_image)

The predicted output image may include highlighted regions, annotations, or a heatmap indicating areas of concern related to cardiovascular disease.

## Results

The project aims to achieve high accuracy in detecting cardiovascular diseases through retinal image analysis. Detailed results and model performance metrics will be shared upon completion of the experiments.
