# Retinal Analysis for Cardiovascular Disease

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage retinal imaging to assess and detect cardiovascular diseases. By analyzing retinal images, we can uncover biomarkers and patterns that indicate the presence or risk of cardiovascular conditions, offering a non-invasive and efficient screening tool.

## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. Early detection and continuous monitoring are crucial for effective treatment and management. Retinal imaging provides a unique opportunity to observe blood vessel conditions that may reflect cardiovascular health.

## Objectives

- To develop algorithms for analyzing retinal images to detect cardiovascular disease.
- To identify key biomarkers in retinal images that correlate with cardiovascular conditions.
- To create a user-friendly tool for healthcare professionals to assess cardiovascular risk using retinal images.

## Datasets

The project uses publicly available datasets of retinal images, including but not limited to:
- [Retina Image Bank](https://www.imagebank.asrs.org/)
- [STARE (Structured Analysis of the Retina)](http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/)

## Input and Output

The project processes retinal images and provides predictions on cardiovascular disease risk. Below are examples of input images and their predicted outputs.

### Predicted Output
![Predicted Output](path_to_output_image)

The predicted output image may include highlighted regions, annotations, or a heatmap indicating areas of concern related to cardiovascular disease.

## Results

The project aims to achieve high accuracy in detecting cardiovascular diseases through retinal image analysis. Detailed results and model performance metrics will be shared upon completion of the experiments.
